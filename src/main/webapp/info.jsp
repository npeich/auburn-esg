    <br>
    <p>ESG Materiality
    <br>
    The Environmental, Social, and Governance risks and opportunities, posed by long-term science-based
    trends like climate change, global warming, energy transitions, consumer spending shifts, and world
    economy and demographic shifts. Organizations more than ever face the major challenges as well as risks
    and opportunities of adapting their business operations to the ESG trends.
    The material risks to an industry exposes the same risks to individual organizations. The same materiality
    applies to organizations able to capitalize on profit and opportunities.
    ESG Enterprise Rating methodology focuses on multiple levels of materiality from global, country, industryspecific issues.
    The research team seeks to answer critical questions of what are the most significant risks facing the
    organizations and their industry. Subsequently, it also answers how well organizations manage those risks
    and opportunities. Finally, the system ranks the organization's ESG standings against its industry peers for
    each country.
    <br><br>
    Risks
    <br>
    Material ESG risks are identified by ESG Enterprise Research Committee on a quarterly basis based on
    countries and industries. Once issues are selected, the Data Research team sets the weights and impacts
    based on AI-driven algorithms that contribute to the overall ESG Rating. The process applies to all three
    E, S, G criteria. The final risks are aggregated and reviewed by the data analysts who may curate the data
    based on direct communication and questionnaire with the organizationsâ€™ investor relations department.
    Typical risks are usually related to climate change impacts, emissions mitigation, and adaptation,
    environmental management practices and duty of care, working and safety condition, respect for human
    rights, anti-bribery and corruption practices, and compliance to relevant laws and regulations.
    <br><br>
