Cycle 2 Version Description

Introduction
The ESG Investment Tool is a web application that allows investors to see how companies they invest in score in terms of their environmental, social, and governance policies (ESG). The scores display the societal and world impacts of the company and allow the investor to make educated decisions on the companies they invest in.

Scope
	The ESG Investment Tool allows investors to be informed on companies that they are investing in. Some investors may prefer companies that are environmentally friendly or may prefer companies that treat their workers properly. This tool allows them to see how these companies score and therefore allows them to make investments that they agree with. In this version, the team was able to make a successful connection to the database as well as have the front and back end communicate with each other.
Version Description

      3.1 New Features
	For this cycle, we were able to have the ends of the program communicate with each other. This allows for the front end to access the APIâ€™s on the backend and display information on the web application. The front end now displays information regarding the companies ESG scores and organizes the companies saved into a portfolio. 
	The back end also received some updates. We were able to create a database manager class that should be able to save stocks from the front end and store them in the database.
  
       3.2 Known Problems
	There are currently a couple issues regarding both ends of the project. One of the issues with the front end is it will sometimes store the same stock multiple times in the portfolio. On the backend we have run into some issues regarding properly storing information within the database as well as occasionally not being able to make a connection.
